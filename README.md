# Descripton
## This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for a minimal and highly customizable Linux setup. It is primarily designed for Arch Linux using the Hyprland window manager, and includes configs for terminal, UI, and various utilities. It's perfect for those who want a clean and stylish desktop environment built around performance and aesthetics. Easy to use and for Hyprland newbiesðŸ’«
